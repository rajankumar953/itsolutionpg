        <div>
            <p>An information technology (IT) solution is a set of related software programs and/or services that are
                sold as a
                single package. IT vendors, service providers and value-added resellers (VARs) market their software
                suites and
                service bundles under the label solution to promote the idea that purchasing the product will help the
                customer
                successfully solve a problem or deal with a complicated situation.</p>
            <p>Many vendors, software developers, in particular, refer to all of their individual products as software
                solutions. For example, a vendor may call its antivirus software a solution because it helps to solve a
                particular problem.</p>
            <p>In a stricter sense, however, an IT solution is an aggregation of products and services, as opposed to a
                single,
                discrete product. To accurately be called a solution, therefore, the antivirus software should be
                bundled with
                related products, such as a spam filter or backup service.</p>
            <p>The product versus solution distinction extends back to the 1970s, when VARs emerged. At that time, the
                rise of
                microcomputers moved computing beyond the glass house and out to other departments, such as
                manufacturing and
                engineering. In response, VARs bundled software -- their own or a third-party package -- with a
                particular
                hardware platform and sold the bundle as a turnkey solution designed specifically for a particular use
                case.
                Frequently, such hardware/software solutions targeted customers in niche vertical markets.</p>
            <h4>Types of IT solution providers</h4>
            <p>In the 1980s, some VARs began marketing themselves as solution sellers or solution providers -- a label
                that many
                channel partners continue to use today. VARs and channel partners learned to get close to their
                customers, learn
                about their pain points and then bundle products to solve their problems. Systems integrators also
                emerged under
                the solution provider banner, offering a mix of consulting, software customization and implementation
                services.
                In the 1990s, VARs began to offer consulting and other professional services to complement their turnkey
                solutions.</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of local area networks in the late 1980s and early 1990s gave rise to network solutions,
                as
                customers requested help in designing, installing and supporting networks. Network-oriented resellers,
                also
                known as network integrators, initially focused on Novell's NetWare product, but eventually shifted
                their
                network solutions' emphasis to Windows and open source operating systems, as those software platforms
                gained
                networking capabilities.</p>
            <h3>Internet expands possibilities for IT solution providers</h3>
            <p>The arrival of the internet pushed the IT solution industry in new directions. By the late 1990s and
                early 2000s,
                managed service providers began to emerge. These companies took advantage of the internet as a cost
                effective
                means to remotely oversee their customers' on-premises solutions using lights-out management. This
                development
                quickly turned remote monitoring and management into another component of IT solutions.</p>
            <p>More recently, cloud computing has further expanded IT solution possibilities. Solution providers now
                offer
                customers infrastructure as a service, software as a service and other on-demand offerings. The provider
                either
                builds and supports its own proprietary cloud services or resells (or recommends) the services of a
                public cloud
                provider. Examples of cloud providers include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazon Web Services - a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.com.
                </li>
                <li>Google Cloud Platform - a suite of public cloud computing services offered by Google.
                    Microsoft Azure - Microsoft's public cloud computing platform.</li>
                <li>Salesforce Service Cloud - a customer relationship management (CRM) platform for customer service
                    and
                    support, based on Salesforce's CRM software for sales professionals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cloud solution providers offer consulting and professional services around one or more cloud platforms,
                helping
                customers use public, private and hybrid cloud environments to solve business problems.</p>
